// 1- Role of Operators in JavaScript

// Operators in JavaScript are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on operands.
//  They are the building blocks of expressions and enable developers to execute 
//  computations, make decisions, and manipulate data effectively.

//2-Why Are Operators Essential in Programming?

// Foundation of Expressions:
// Operators form the basis of most expressions, enabling calculations, comparisons, and decisions.

// Simplify Code:
// Operators allow compact expressions that are easy to read and write. For example:
// let result = (x > 10) ? "Greater" : "Smaller";

// Enable Decision-Making:
// Conditional and logical operators play a vital role in control structures like if-else, while, and for.

// Data Manipulation:
// Operators provide tools to manipulate and transform data effectively, e.g., using arithmetic, bitwise, or string operators.

// Improve Efficiency:
// Using operators like assignment shorthand (+=, *=) reduces repetitive code and enhances performance.

// Support Dynamic Programming:
// JavaScriptâ€™s dynamic nature relies heavily on operators to determine types, compare values, and handle diverse data structures.
