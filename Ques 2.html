    <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17pt;">Typically, course designers design a Full Stack Web Development Course to teach individuals the necessary skills and knowledge to develop web applications from start to finish.
    This means that the course covers both the front-end development (client-side) and back-end development (server-side) aspects of web development.

        Front-end development involves designing and developing the user interface, which includes the layout, design, and functionality of the website or application that users see and interact with. This typically involves using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        
         On the other hand, back-end development involves working with server-side technologies such as databases, servers, and programming languages like Python, Ruby, or JavaScript to create the logic behind the scenes that makes the application function.</p>
