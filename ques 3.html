    <p>Hello! I'm Nayan Awasthi, a passionate learner with a strong foundation in mathematics and programming. I completed my schooling at SKD Academy and went on to earn a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from BSNV PG College, affiliated with the University of Lucknow. Currently, I am pursuing my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) at the University of Lucknow (Second Campus).

        Alongside my academic pursuits, I am developing expertise in full-stack web development through PW Skills, where I'm gaining hands-on experience in creating dynamic, responsive websites. I am proficient in C, C++, and Java, with a commitment to expanding my skills and staying updated with the latest in technology.
