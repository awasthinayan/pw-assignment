    <h1>Accessibility in Web Development</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Definition of Accessibility</h2>
        <p>
            Accessibility in web development refers to designing and developing websites, tools, and technologies 
            so that they can be used by all people, regardless of their physical, sensory, cognitive, or technological limitations. 
            This includes users with disabilities such as visual impairments, hearing loss, motor difficulties, and cognitive challenges.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Why Accessibility is Essential</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Inclusivity:</strong> Ensures that everyone, including people with disabilities, 
                can access and interact with web content without barriers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Many countries have laws mandating web accessibility, 
                such as the <em>ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)</em> in the U.S. or the 
                <em>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</em> globally. Non-compliance can lead to legal action.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Broader Reach:</strong> Makes websites usable for a larger audience, including those with temporary impairments 
                (e.g., injuries) or situational challenges (e.g., using a phone in bright sunlight).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Improved User Experience:</strong> Accessibility features like clear navigation, captions, 
                and keyboard shortcuts enhance usability for everyone, not just users with disabilities.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Search Engine Optimization (SEO):</strong> Accessible practices such as adding descriptive alt text for images 
                and using semantic HTML improve a site's SEO, helping it rank higher in search engines.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Benefits to Different User Groups</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>People with Disabilities:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Visual impairments:</em> Screen readers, alternative text for images, and scalable fonts ensure content is perceivable.</li>
                    <li><em>Hearing impairments:</em> Subtitles, transcripts, and sign language interpretations for multimedia make auditory content accessible.</li>
                    <li><em>Motor disabilities:</em> Keyboard navigation and voice control support allow users to interact without relying on a mouse.</li>
                    <li><em>Cognitive disabilities:</em> Simple layouts, clear language, and consistent design reduce cognitive load.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Older Adults:</strong> Accessibility features like larger fonts, higher contrast, and simplified navigation cater to age-related challenges such as reduced vision or motor skills.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>People with Temporary Limitations:</strong> Those recovering from injuries (e.g., broken arm) or experiencing environmental challenges 
                (e.g., loud noise or poor lighting) benefit from accessible designs.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Users with Low Bandwidth or Older Devices:</strong> Optimized content that loads efficiently and works on basic hardware ensures accessibility for users with limited internet connectivity.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Creating accessible websites is a moral, legal, and practical imperative. It ensures inclusivity, 
            improves the overall user experience, and broadens the reach of web content. 
            By making the web accessible, developers empower all users, regardless of their abilities, 
            to engage with and benefit from online information and services.
