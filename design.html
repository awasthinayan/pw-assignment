    <p>Most brick-and-mortar businesses are making an attempt to have an online presence in recent times to widen their client base and have a better reach. However, with thousands of websites in every niche, it truly takes more than a mere online presence to outdo competitors and build trust with customers. One of the best ways to achieve this is by having your website designed in a way that is visually pleasing and immersive while offering your audience exactly what they look for. If you wonder what web designing is and the benefits it offers, here’s everything you need to know.</p>
    <p>Web designers create the design and layout of a website with their technical expertise and knowledge while keeping in mind the client’s requirements. They have a deep understanding of UI (user interface) and UX (user experience) and are adept at using design programs for creating visual elements. With their skills and expertise, web designers capture the brand’s identity in the design elements of the website.</p>
    <p>Visitors rate their experience with a specific website based on its aesthetics and how intuitive it is in terms of navigation. Therefore, web designers use Adobe, CorelDraw, Inkscape, and other design programs to create animations, graphics, icons, logos, and other elements of a website to make it as interactive as possible. Web designers also focus on the creative and visual side of the website and follow various design practices, such as symmetry, color systems, proportions, etc. to engage visitors. Additionally, they work on fonts, placement of images and videos, and creating layouts using coding languages.</p>
